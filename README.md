# Hospital_readmission_prediction
This project focuses on predicting hospital readmissions using the diabetic dataset, leveraging various machine learning algorithms and model interpretation techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

Project Overview
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model to determine if a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. The workflow includes extensive data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training with different algorithms, and evaluating the performance of the models.

Key Steps and Components
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded and cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns, such as encounter_id and patient_nbr.
Label encoding is applied to categorical features for model compatibility.
The target variable readmitted is converted to a binary classification: 0 for 'NO' and 1 for '<30' or '>30'.
Model Training and Evaluation:

XGBoost Model: Used as a primary classifier with performance evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.
LightGBM Model: Explored as another efficient gradient boosting model.
Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy, with visualizations for feature importance using built-in plotting functions.
Feature Importance and Interpretation:

Feature Importance: Visualized using XGBoost and LightGBM's built-in plotting capabilities.
SHAP Analysis: Applied to interpret model predictions and understand which features most contribute to predicting readmissions. A SHAP summary plot provides a comprehensive view of feature impacts.
Results and Insights
The models are evaluated based on their ability to predict hospital readmissions. Key insights into feature importance and relationships are provided through SHAP analysis, which helps interpret the modelâ€™s decisions.
The feature importance plots highlight the most influential variables in determining the readmission status, while the SHAP analysis provides a deeper understanding of feature interactions.
Visualizations
Feature Importance Plots: Show which features have the highest impact on the model's decisions.
SHAP Summary Plot: Offers an interpretable view of how each feature influences model predictions, helping to understand the direction and magnitude of each feature's effect.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, shap, matplotlib
