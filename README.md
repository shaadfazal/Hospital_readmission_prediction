# Hospital Readmission Prediction Project

Predicting hospital readmissions using the diabetic dataset, leveraging advanced machine learning models and interpretation techniques. The project covers comprehensive data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and detailed feature importance analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. The workflow involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and encoding data.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and comparing performance across different algorithms.
- **Interpretation**: Using SHAP values to gain insights into model behavior.

## üîç **Key Steps and Components**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns like `encounter_id` and `patient_nbr` are removed.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features are label-encoded to prepare the data for machine learning models.
- **Target Variable Conversion**: The `readmitted` column is converted into a binary target: 
  - `0` for 'NO'
  - `1` for '<30' or '>30'

### 2. **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **XGBoost Model**: Used as a primary classifier. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
- **LightGBM Model**: Another gradient boosting model is explored for its efficiency.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Detailed classification reports and visualizations are generated, including:
  - **Accuracy**: The overall correctness of the model.
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Evaluated to understand model performance comprehensively.

### 3. **Feature Importance and Interpretation**
- **Feature Importance Plots**: Using built-in functions from XGBoost and LightGBM to visualize the most impactful features.
- **SHAP Analysis**: 
  - **SHAP Values**: Provide interpretability by explaining the influence of each feature on the model's predictions.
  - **SHAP Summary Plot**: A detailed visualization showing feature impacts, interaction effects, and feature importance.

## üìä **Results and Insights**
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are analyzed based on their effectiveness in predicting readmissions.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Feature importance analysis identifies the critical variables affecting readmission status.
  - SHAP analysis offers a transparent and interpretable understanding of how each feature influences the model, highlighting both the direction and magnitude of their effects.
